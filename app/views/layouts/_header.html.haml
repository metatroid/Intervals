          Greetings fellow Internet User!
        %p
          This text exists to notify you that we are now accepting your generosity in the form of totally optional monetary contributions!
        %p
          This service will always be free of charge. We also offer the <a href="https://github.com/metatroid/Intervals" target="_blank">source code</a> for you to use as you wish.
        %p
          Since that is sort of awesome, wouldn't it be even more awesome if we were able to support our server and development costs solely through your own sheer amazingness?
        %p
          If so, consider making a contribution through the form on the right.  Thank you.
        %p
